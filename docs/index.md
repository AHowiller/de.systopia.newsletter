# Overview

Sending Newsletters with CiviCRM is a common task and there is some useful
functionality in core for that purpose, including Double-Opt-In e-mails,
multiple newsletter groups, etc.

However, when offering a lot of mailing lists, users should have means for
managing their subscriptions. Also, CiviCRM forms may not be suitable for every
scenario.

Instead of creating external forms and custom API actions for each project, this
extension offers configurable newsletter form profiles, along with an API action
to use as an endpoint for external forms.

Additionally, a Drupal module
[CiviCRM Advanced Newsletter Management](https://github.com/systopia/civicrm_newsletter)
is available as a usable sample implementation of this extension's API endpoint.
